HTML and CSS practice to copy the [Google.com search results page](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage) as of 30/10/2018.


By doing this project, I will have to:
- Decide which HTML elements are needed
- Use an external CSS file to style the page
- Create a form and buttons
- Arrange the layout of the page using CSS
